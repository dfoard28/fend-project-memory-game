# Project Overview
This is a memory game. User will click on two cards, if they are a match then the cards will change color and stay turned over, if the cards are not a match then the cards will flip back over. Once the user has matched all of the cards a dialog will come up giving the amount of time it took to beat the game, a star rating, and also ask if they would like to play again.
